MissingOutputException in rule read_data in file /home/jovyan/assignment-2-python-refresher-arer2562/by_country.snakemake, line 16:
Job 2  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
red_data.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
