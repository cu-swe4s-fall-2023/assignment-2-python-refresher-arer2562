Error in rule subset_data:
    jobid: 3
    input: Agrofood_co2_emission.csv
    output: subsetted_data.csv
    shell:
        python subset.py Agrofood_co2_emission.csv
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job subset_data since they might be corrupted:
subsetted_data.csv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
